# rust-minigrep

`rust-minigrep` is a simple command-line application (CLI) for searching text within files.  
This project is written in **Rust** and inspired by the *minigrep* example in *The Rust Programming Language* book.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Search for a substring in a text file.
- Supports **case-sensitive** search (default).
- Supports **case-insensitive** search by setting the `IGNORE_CASE` environment variable.
- Simple error handling (e.g., when file is missing or arguments are insufficient).
- Includes unit tests to verify search functionality.
